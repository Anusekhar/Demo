      <h3>Sachin Tendulkar (born 24 April 1973) is a former Indian cricketer and captain,
        widely regarded to be one of the greatest cricketers of all time and by many as the greatest batsman of all time.
        He took up cricket at the age of eleven,
        made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen,
        and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years.
         He is the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries,
         the first batsman to score a double century in a One Day International,
         holds the record for most number of runs in both ODI and Test cricket,
         the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket.
        In 2002 just half way through his career, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack ranked him the second greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman,
        and the second greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.Later in his career,
       Tendulkar was a part of the Indian team that won the 2011 World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India.
       He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 edition of the tournament, held in South Africa. In 2013,
       he was the only Indian cricketer included in an all-time Test World XI named to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack.
